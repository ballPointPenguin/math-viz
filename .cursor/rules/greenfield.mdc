## Greenfield Development Guidelines

This project is currently in rapid, exploratory development and **not yet deployed to any production environment**. It is therefore highly tolerant of breaking changes, aggressive refactoring, and rapid iteration. The following guidelines should inform all development decisions during this phase:

- **Move Fast, Break Things**: Prioritize speed of iteration and improvement over stability or backward compatibility.
- **Direct Schema Changes**: Prefer directly editing database schemas over creating incremental, sequential migrations.
- **Aggressive Refactoring**: Freely move, rename, or restructure modules, classes, functions, and files to maintain clarity, simplicity, and adherence to best practices.
- **Remove Rather than Deprecate**: Fully delete outdated or unnecessary code paths immediately instead of marking them as deprecated.
- **Postpone Production Considerations**: Do not spend time addressing deployment, scalability, or backward compatibility at this stageâ€”these concerns will be addressed later.
- **No Upgrade Documentation**: Do not document upgrade paths or compatibility strategies for hypothetical or future users of older versions.

However, continue to rigorously monitor and maintain:

- **Unit and Integration Tests**
- **Linting and Code Style Enforcement**
- **Best Practices in Coding and Architecture**

Embrace this opportunity to innovate quickly and boldly. Fail forward!
